# My-First-Python-Project

Here’s a simple keylogger I created that logs all keyboard inputs and saves them to a file named Data.txt.

I'm open to any suggestions for improving the code, as this is my first project I’m sharing. Feel free to recommend any modifications or tweaks.

To run the program, you’ll need to install the "keyboard" package first by using the command: pip install keyboard
